## R You Ready for Neural Networks

Developed a neural network that analyzes data of car crashes and predicts the
injury severity of the passenger based on the attributes of the car crash. This was
accomplished by using R along with the Keras package which is a high-level neural
networks API.

## Getting Started

Before installing the environment, verify you are running a Windows OS on your
machine. Confirm that your machine is able to run the minimum specified requirements
for RStudio found at
https://www.r-studio.com/Unformat_Help/index2.html?systemrequirements.html

### Installing and Running

1) Install the R language Binaries at ​https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
2) Install RStudio at ​https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.1.442.exe
3) Install Anaconda 5.1, Python 3.6 version at
https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.1.0-Windows-x86_64.exe
4) Open RStudio and install the package “keras” using the console in RStudio, use the
command ​install.package(“keras”)​.
5) Install packages “plotly”, “caret”, and “e1071” using the same command
install.package(“<PackageName>”)​.
6) Open the project source file PredictingCarCrashInjuries.R in RStudio
7) After opening the project source file use:
Session>Set Working Directory>To Source File Location
8) To run the complete file use ​Code>Run Region>Run All​ or use ​Ctrl+Alt+R
9) To run a subsection of the code highlight the code you wish to run and use
Ctrl+Enter
To see the running code, please look at “code.pdf” file
